## 1. NY CS standard: 9-12.CT.3 Data Analysis and Visualization
* Refine and visualize complex data sets to tell different stories with the same data set. 

I am fortunate to create my own curriculum. One curriculum I am currently working on is Data Analysis, which I offer for math credit.  I took a Data Science course and hope to add more CS to the Data Analysis course.  I didn't like the Bootstrap platform, and hope to take Layla Q's Data Science fellowship next year to learn a new platform.  The following task is part of a unit of focusing on different calculations of/in the human body.

A task is to collect the number of calories that you consume over a month (broken into sections).  Student can choose what to focus on: some examples: time of meal (breakfast,lunch, dinner, snack), breakdown of nutrients (carbs, fat, protein), etc. They have to then visual their data set.  They can create different graphs that then tell different stories using the same set of data. For differentation: students can pair in groups of two to work together (if they need support, and work on one data set), or for higher students they can gather data from multiple people to create a larger data set and then use an app (after doing their own research) to assist in analysing, refining, and visualizing subsets of data.  Examples of websites to send students: excel, D3.js, Python (Seaborn).  The image below is from one student who collected one week's worth of data.

A student created a pie chart and one analysis is that their caloric snack intake was greater than their caloric breakfast and lunch intake combined.  This analysis was aided by the visualization of the graph and not realized by viewing the data in table format.  My goal is to improve the curriculum so that students can do this using larget sets of data and computer programs to aid in the analysis. 


## 2. NY CS standard: 9-12.CT.6 Algorithms and Programming
* Demonstrate how at least two classic algorithms work, and analyze the trade-offs related to two or more algorithms for completing the same task.

A lesson warm-up to this concept is the distrubtion property. The warm-up will ask students to solve 8(4+5) in two different ways.  The write-up to this problem will include the following two questions:  a) Then ask which way is better and why.  b) Are there trade-offs for solving the task when done a certain way.  In the warm-up, students can first add and then multiple OR they can distribute the 8 to both parts by multiplying first and then adding the results.  

This warm-up is to lead students to understanding the concept of this standard before seeing the CS application of it.  I am excited to continue to study CS so that I can get to the level to have examples of this standard for high school in CS that I can draw on from my prior knowledge base.  It is benefical to have students demonstrate how two classic algorithms work. The ability to analyze the trade-offs related to at least two algorithms to complete the same task will carry over into other school subjects. Computational thinking leads to problem solving and our world has plenty of issues that will rely on future computer scientists.
