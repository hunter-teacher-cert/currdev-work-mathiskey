# Different types of assignment


# 1. Parallax Scrolling

Type of assignment:  Group-based classwork

Lesson 7: The assignment is to learn a new layout feature called Parallax Scrolling.

Student Facing Instructions:

Task:
1. Think, pair, Share. View the photographer, Nolan Omura, [website](url).  What do you notice about the layout of the images?  Can you explain how it works?

- Teacher notes: Draw from the conversation: how the images are moving, movement of the turtle

2. Let's find out the code that is making the images scroll.  

- Teacher notes:  Introduce this new layout feature as: Parallax Scrolling and then define it.  Parallax scrolling is where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling.  At this stage in the Unit, we are working towards independence of finding new layout features and learning how to implement them to our personal website.  Work with your group to visit [W3schools](url) to annotate the code.  Make sure you find the specific code that is changing the different speeds of the foreground content while scrolling. OR visit [Bootstrap](url) to modify the pre-packaged code. 

3. Add this new layout feature to your personal website. You have the rest of class to incorporate this new feature.  If you don't finish in class then it becomes homework.  It is due @ the beginning of next class as always.

- Teacher notes: If groups were not able to get the code to work, then give them the code from another group that was able to get their background/foreground to scroll. See if they can decipher where to change the codes in order to add this to their personal website. 


# 2. Another feature is...

Type of assignment:  Open ended project

Lesson 8: The assignment is to explore another feature not yet discussed in class. 

Student Facing Instructions:

It's your choice. Search and find a feature not yet discussed. Use either Bootstrap or w3schools to grab the code and modify. Let your teacher know once you have decided on a new feature.  It is due @ the beginning of next class as always.
