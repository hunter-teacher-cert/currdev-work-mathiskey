# Javascript Language 

Q: What is the course? (grade level, student experience)

A: Creative Web (open grade level, I teach at a transfer high school).  All CS courses are intro semester long and for most students, this is their first and only CS experience.  Creative Web is an intro web development class that teaches html, css, and I hope to include advanced css and javascript.

----

Q: What is the language?

A: Javascript

----

Q: How does one write & run code in this language?

A: Javascript writes using text and runs code in real time.

----

Q: Rate the complexity of the syntax?

A: It is more difficult than python but not as complicated as java w/ respect to syntax. 

----

Q: Strengths

A:  --- Runs in real time, so it runs fast.  

--- It is relatively simple to learn, much simplier than C++.

----

Q: How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?

A:  --- Students can get immediate feedback/results when exectuing a program.  I don't have to use class time with teaching them how to complie the code before running it. 

--- This strength helps a lot in my classes because I only get students for one semester, so with the limited time, having a simplier language to learn is essential/ideal.

----

Q: Weaknesses

A: --- Client side security: bugs and oversights might be exploited for malicious purposes.

--- browser support: different browsers sometimes interpret Javascript differently.

----

Q: How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?

A: --- teaching students how to debug will help to mitigate this weekness

--- teaching students how to test their script in all major browsers will help to mitigate this weekness. 

----

Q: Why did you select this language for this class?

A: I teach only intro level courses, and after students learn the markdown languages of html and csss, if they have time to make the website interactive than the language used for website design is javascript.  I don't know of any other language used in web development for interactivity.
