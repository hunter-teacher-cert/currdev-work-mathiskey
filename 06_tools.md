Two technological tools I currently use in my classroom:


| Overarching Theme | Name of Tool   | General Purpose   | Classes used in  | Tools use in class  | Purpose of selection of tool |
| :-----------:| :-----------: |:-------------:| :-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Programming | html/css/javascript  | html aids with adding content, css aids with stylistic changes and javascript can be used to add in user interaction features | Creative Web (previously this course originiated as a CS4ALL curriculum that used p5.js but I have amended the curriculum to not include the p5.js lessons | To accomplish our goals of creating a website from scratch | This is the only programming tool that I know of that is currently used to build front end web development |
| Communication  | Google Classroom | Creates a platform where the teacher can provide materials and collect assignments in one place |Creative Web (I use this communication tool in all of my classes) |  This choice of tool easily syncs with their DOE schools account and provides a platform to send assignments, give comments, and send messages. |There is no need for additional accounts for the students. Google Classroom will be used in our Unit to post the assignments and assessments.  Feedback will also be given using a combination of Google Classroom and Replit. A lot of these features are also free which we need in our schools. |
