Two technological tools I currently use in my classroom:


| Name of Tool   | General Purpose   | Classes used in  | How is it used in class?  | Purpose of selection of tool |
| :-----------: |:-------------:| :-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Programming      | ?? | ?? |?? |?? |
| ???      | ?? | ?? |?? |?? |


Categorizing tools into overarching themes gives the following: Programming , Communication, Collaboration, Code/Work Collection,  Presentation, Learning Management, and OS.  We choose to use either Windows or Mac OS as the Operating System.  We each teach at different schools and this Unit is intended to be used in any public school classroom with either Windows or Mac OS.  We are also choosing Replit as both our IDE and Code/Work Collection tool.  Replit has many programming languages to choose from, and for this Unit we will be using HTML, CSS, Javascript.  Replit also has a lot more features that are useful in our Unit like multiplayer, and teams/classroom, and auto-saving. Finally, we will use Google Classroom as our Communication Tool.  This choice of tool easily syncs with their DOE schools account and provides a platform to send assignments, give comments, and send messages. There is no need for additional accounts for the students. Google Classroom will be used in our Unit to post the assignments and assessments.  Feedback will also be given using a combination of Google Classroom and Replit. A lot of these features are also free which we need in our schools. The tools used in this unit are appropriate for the content of advanced layout web design and using libraries.  The tools mentioned previously are also intended for 8th -12th grade.
