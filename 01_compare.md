Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a pre-packaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with similar focus).


For other courses, look around for pre-packaged courses with similar aims. Many of the Curriculum providers we looked at for AP CSP also provide intro courses at the least.
Alternatively: Elementary school teachers that cannot find anything similar to compare to, or masters students may opt to compare two of the APCSP curricula that were linked in the Async portion of the assignment.

Focus on the following:
Major differences
Major similiarities
Comparative streangths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).
Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?
