### Comparison of two curriculums:  CS Creative Web and CS Discoveries 

The course I currently teach takes part of a pre-packaged curriculum, and the course I am comparing is also a pre-packaged curriculum I have taught in the past that I don't intend to use again.  I have not yet built my own CS course, I have only used pre-packaged courses from CS4ALL.
