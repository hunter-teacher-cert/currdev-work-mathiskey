Comparison of two curriculums:  CS Creative Web and CS Discoveries 


Major differences
Major similiarities
Comparative streangths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).
Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?
