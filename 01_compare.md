### Comparison of two curriculums:  CS Creative Web and CS Discoveries 

The course I currently teach takes part of a pre-packaged curriculum, and the course I am comparing is also a pre-packaged curriculum I have taught in the past that I don't intend to use again.  I have not yet built my own CS course, I have only used pre-packaged courses from CS4ALL. 


Comparison | CS Creative Web | CS Discoveries
--- | --- | ---
Author | CS4ALL (Created by NYC DOE teachers) | code.org (national organization)
Major Differences | Creative web uses the open source Javascript library p5.js platform to teach html/css/ and expressive and creative applications using p5. It is text-based only.  It is aligned to the CS4ALL blueprint for CS education. | takes a wide lens on intro CS topics and Unit #2 is web development, but doesn't teach p5. It is both block and text base. It is aligned to CSTA standards.  
Major similiarities | Free curriculum, Grade levels for middle school, intro level work | Free curriculu, Grade levels for 6th to 10th grade, intro level work
Comparative strengths | hands-on approach called creative computing, it is very visual.   | Offers a variety of topics throughout the year where students build their own websites, apps, animations, games and physical computing systems.  
Comparative weaknesses | Doesn't cover html, and css much. For example, the Bootstrap library is not introduced. | Very heavy on text based, it needs additional videos to reach a vareity of learners.
Adopt anything from the pre-packaged curriculum & why | Can't answer this because I have not yet created my own CS curriulum | same as other answer
